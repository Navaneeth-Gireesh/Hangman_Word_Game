# Hangman Word Game

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game **Hangman**. The game randomly selects a word, and the player attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project was inspired by the online version of [Hangman Word Game](https://hangmanwordgame.com/).

## Features

- **Player Feedback:** Displays the current progress of the word with correctly guessed letters.
- **Lives System:** Players have a limited number of lives (6) to guess the word.
- **Graphical Feedback:** ASCII art is used to represent the hangman’s state as the player loses lives.
- **Replayability:** The word list includes a variety of words, allowing for multiple rounds of gameplay.
